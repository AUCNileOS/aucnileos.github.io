<!-- TODO: Introduction -->
This document serves as documentation for the efforts done by Omar Elfouly, Pimyn Girgis, and Bevly Remon during Spring 2025.

The goal of this documentation is to record every experiment we have preformed in order to assist anyone attempting to continue developing NileOS.

We will begin by describing the [environment](nix.md) we have set up and then we will proceed with describing the [experiments](runningNileOS.md) we preformed.

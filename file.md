As a graduating Computer Science senior with a strong passion for low-level and hardware programming, I am writing to
express my interest in the AUC Open Hardware Lab Summer Internship. My background includes two internships at Google,
one focused on Syzkaller kernel fuzzing, demonstrating my system-level analysis and problem-solving skills. Proficient
in multiple programming languages (C, Python, Rust, Go, ...), I am eager to apply my skills and learn about hardware
development within your innovative lab. The opportunity to gain hands-on experience in open hardware aligns perfectly
with my academic and career aspirations in system-level engineering.
